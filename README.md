# challenge_1_seo_website_rework (accessibility)

# User Story
AS A marketing/creative agency
I WANT to update this site with accessibility that is up to standard
SO THAT users can read/understand/use this site no matter who I am in the world and it ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies,
SO THAT this site is enhanced for search engines accross platforms

In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

This is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who is requesting the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. This follows an AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format. For example, "AS A shopper visiting an online store, I WANT to place items in a shopping cart, SO THAT I can purchase them.

## Acceptance Criteria: 
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards:
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

GIVEN the scout rule:  
WHEN I am finished reviewing the code
THEN it will be cleaner than I found it

GIVEN a fully functioning webpage 
THEN I find all links are functioning correctly

REWORK 
Rework the CSS to be more efficient by:
_consolidating CSS selectors and properties
_organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page

## Mock-up: 
This is an image or animation that demonstrates the design and functionality of the web application that you'll build for the Challenge.

## Submission: 
You'll submit your completed Challenge for review. In the real world, when a developer finishes working on a project, another developer reviews the code, providing feedback on errors and making sure that all of the acceptance criteria have been met. For each Challenge, your instructional staff will serve as your team of reviewers.
